<!-- HOT LEAD SCRIPT -->
<div class="section-label">Temperature: Hot (Score 80-100)</div>
<div class="script-card">
<div class="script-header">
<span class="tag tag-hot">Hot Lead</span>
<h3>Coaching Consultation Close</h3>
</div>
<div class="script-body">
<p><strong>Context:</strong> This lead has high training volume, a committed objective, and strong desire for expert guidance. They likely booked a free consultation from the quiz results page or HP email sequence. They are ready. Do not over-educate. Validate and close.</p>

<div class="script-note"><strong>Before the call:</strong> Review their quiz results. Know their profile (Summit Chaser, Trail Blazer, etc.), their score, and their answers to Q1 (discipline), Q5 (challenge), and Q6 (committed objective).</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Thanks for taking the Mountain Training Profile quiz and booking this consultation. I saw your results. You came through as a [profile name] with a strong readiness score. Tell me about your objective. What's on the calendar?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>[Describes their expedition/race/objective and timeline]</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"That's a serious objective. How are you feeling about your preparation right now? Your quiz results showed [reference their Q4 confidence level and Q5 challenge]."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>[Describes current training and concerns]</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"What you're describing is exactly the kind of situation where structured coaching makes the biggest difference. You're already putting in the work. The question is whether every training hour is aligned with what [their objective] specifically demands. Here's how we'd approach it..."</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Transition to coaching pitch:</strong></p>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Based on your timeline and where you are right now, here's what a coaching partnership would look like. Your coach would build a periodized plan working backward from [objective date]. You'd get daily workouts delivered through TrainingPeaks, in-depth feedback on every session, and regular contact whenever you have questions. The goal is for you to arrive at [objective] in the best mountain-specific fitness of your life."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"What does coaching cost?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Coaching is [pricing]. I know that's a meaningful investment. Here's how I think about it: you're already investing [reference expedition/race costs] in this objective. Coaching ensures that investment pays off. And we back it with a 100% satisfaction guarantee after 12 weeks. If you're not satisfied with the coaching experience, you get a full refund."</div>
</div>

<div class="script-note"><strong>Close:</strong> "Would you like me to match you with a coach who specializes in [their discipline]? I can set up an intro conversation this week."</div>
</div>
</div>

<!-- WARM LEAD SCRIPT -->
<div class="section-label">Temperature: Warm (Score 50-79)</div>
<div class="script-card">
<div class="script-header">
<span class="tag tag-warm">Warm Lead</span>
<h3>Education + Proof Points</h3>
</div>
<div class="script-body">
<p><strong>Context:</strong> This lead trains regularly but lacks structure. They may be at a plateau or exploring options. They need to understand the value of structured training before they will commit to a purchase. Lead with education, close with a plan or Training Groups recommendation.</p>

<div class="script-note"><strong>Goal:</strong> Help them understand the gap between effort and results, then position the right product. Do not push coaching unless they express strong interest. Plans and Training Groups are the natural entry point for warm leads.</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Thanks for taking the Mountain Training Profile quiz. Your results showed some interesting patterns. You're clearly putting in the training hours, which is great. But your profile also flagged something that's worth talking about. Can I share what I noticed?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"Sure."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Your quiz showed [reference Q5 challenge]. That's one of the most common patterns we see in experienced mountain athletes. Here's why it happens: [explain the training gap, e.g., intensity distribution, lack of periodization]. The good news is, this is fixable with the right structure."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"So what should I change?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"The first thing I'd suggest is getting your intensity distribution right. 80% of your training volume should be at or below your aerobic threshold. Most self-coached athletes spend too much time in the middle zone, which feels productive but doesn't build the base you need."</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Transition to product recommendation:</strong></p>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Based on your profile as a [profile name], there are a couple of paths that would give you the structure you're looking for. A [specific plan name] gives you a periodized program matched to your discipline. You buy it once and own it forever. If you want more flexibility across disciplines, the Training Library gives you access to every plan we offer. And if you want community support on top of that, Training Groups add coach Q&A sessions and accountability."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"Which one would you recommend?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"If you have a specific objective coming up, I'd start with the [specific plan]. If you're more exploratory, the Training Library gives you room to try different approaches. Either way, you'll have evidence-based structure that turns the effort you're already putting in into measurable progress."</div>
</div>

<div class="script-note"><strong>If they ask about coaching:</strong> "Coaching is also an option and it would give you the most personalized experience. If you want to explore that, I can set up a free consultation. But honestly, a solid training plan is a great starting point and may be all you need right now."</div>
</div>
</div>

<!-- COLD LEAD SCRIPT -->
<div class="section-label">Temperature: Cold (Score 0-49)</div>
<div class="script-card">
<div class="script-header">
<span class="tag tag-cold">Cold Lead</span>
<h3>Value Demonstration</h3>
</div>
<div class="script-body">
<p><strong>Context:</strong> This lead is an aspiring mountain athlete, a beginner, or someone returning from a long break. They may be intimidated by structured training. Lead with empathy and education. The goal is to build confidence, not close a sale. Recommend beginner-friendly entry points only.</p>

<div class="script-note"><strong>Key principle:</strong> Remove intimidation at every step. Use "everyone starts somewhere" framing. Never make them feel judged for their fitness level or experience.</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Thanks for taking the Mountain Training Profile quiz. I'm glad you did. The fact that you took the time to assess where you are tells me you're serious about the mountains, even if you're just getting started."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"Yeah, I want to [climb bigger peaks / run mountain trails / get into mountaineering] but I honestly don't know where to begin."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"That's more common than you think. Most of the athletes we work with felt exactly the same way when they started. Here's the thing most people don't realize: mountain fitness is different from gym fitness, but it's completely learnable. And the first step is simpler than you'd expect."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"What's the first step?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"Aerobic base. It sounds technical, but it just means training at a conversational pace for sustained periods. Walking uphill, easy jogging, cycling. 3-4 times a week. It's the engine that powers everything in the mountains. You don't need expensive gear or a fancy gym. You just need consistency."</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Transition to beginner resources:</strong></p>
<div class="dialogue">
<div class="dialogue-line them"><div class="speaker">Lead</div>"Is there a plan or something I can follow?"</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"There is. Our Beginner Mountain Fitness plan is 8 weeks. 3-4 sessions per week. It builds your aerobic base and adds mountain-specific strength progressively. Nothing overwhelming. Athletes who follow it consistently are usually surprised by how much they improve in just two months."</div>
<div class="dialogue-line you"><div class="speaker">You</div>"If you're not ready for a plan yet, our website has a library of free articles on mountain training fundamentals. And the Voices of Experience podcast is a great way to learn from athletes who were once exactly where you are. Everything is there when you're ready."</div>
</div>

<div class="script-note"><strong>Close:</strong> No pressure close. "There's no rush. The mountain will be there. When you're ready to start, the Beginner Mountain Fitness plan is a great first step. And if you ever have questions, you can always reach out."</div>
</div>

<!-- COMMON OBJECTIONS -->
<h2>Common Objections</h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Objection</th><th>Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"Coaching is too expensive."</strong></td><td>"I understand. Here's how I think about it: if you're spending $20K-$80K on an expedition, coaching is 1-2% of that investment. And it's the one thing that determines whether that investment pays off with a summit or a turnaround. We also have training plans starting at $39 and a Training Library at $29/month if coaching isn't the right fit right now."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"I can figure it out myself."</strong></td><td>"Absolutely. Many athletes do. Our book, Training for the Uphill Athlete, is designed for exactly that. It gives you the methodology to write your own plans. If you ever feel like you want more structure or accountability, coaching and plans are there for you."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"I don't have enough time to train."</strong></td><td>"Time is the #1 constraint we hear. Here's the good news: the science shows that 5-6 focused hours per week, structured correctly, can prepare you for serious mountain objectives. It's not about more time. It's about the right time. Our plans are built for busy professionals."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"I'm not fit enough for a training plan."</strong></td><td>"Our Beginner Mountain Fitness plan starts from zero. It's designed for athletes who are just beginning. And our Chamonix Mountain Fit strength program starts at Level 0. There's no minimum fitness requirement. We meet you where you are."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"How is this different from a generic training plan?"</strong></td><td>"Generic plans are built for a hypothetical average athlete. Our plans are built specifically for mountain sports by coaches who have guided athletes to the top of Everest and across UTMB finish lines. The methodology is adapted from 100 years of endurance science for the specific demands of altitude, terrain, and multi-hour mountain objectives."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"What if coaching doesn't work for me?"</strong></td><td>"We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee after 12 weeks. If you're not satisfied with the coaching experience, you get a full refund. No other mountain coaching service offers this. We can because the methodology works."</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>"I had a bad experience with a coach before."</strong></td><td>"That's a real concern. Not all coaching is the same. Our approach is evidence-based, not opinion-based. You get daily feedback, data-driven adjustments, and a coach who specializes in your discipline. The free consultation lets you meet the coach first before committing."</td></tr>
